# ML Classic Algorithms from Scratch

This repository is a work-in-progress collection of implementations of classic machine learning algorithms written from scratch (without using high-level ML libraries).  

The goal is to better understand the inner workings of these algorithms by building them step by step in pure Python.

## Status
ðŸš§ This project is still under development.  
New algorithms will be added over time.  

## Implemented (or in progress)
- [x] Linear Regression  
- [ ] Logistic Regression  
- [ ] K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- [ ] Decision Tree  
- [ ] Naive Bayes  
- [ ] Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- [ ] K-Means Clustering
